Create and configure exit intent popups that appear when user intends to leave your website.

== Description ==

WP Exit Popups lets create and configure exit intent popups that appear when the user intends to leave your website, resulting in increased conversions or sign-ups, depending on the type of popup you create. You can create and configure as many popups as you like.

You can:

- Create unlimited popups
- Select an initial layout
- Upload a background image
- Insert text (your main message)
- Change the colour, style and position of the close button
- Change the colour and size of the heading and text
- Adjust popup width and padding
- Change the modal mask colour and opacity
- Change box shadow colour
- Insert a form, single URL, shortcode or yes/no links
- Set the lifespan of the popup (how long it will take for the popup to be reinstated after the user dismissed it)
- Force a popup to show immediately instead of on exit intent (giving it traditional popup behaviour)

You can create popups that include your own custom text and URL, a shortcode, yes/no links, or choose a form if you use one of these popular form plugins:

- Gravity Forms
- Contact Form 7
- WP Forms
- Formidable Forms
- Ninja Forms
